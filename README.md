# NonLinearOptimization
We try to pursue well-known supply and use tables problem from the nonlinear optimization perspective.

Firstly I need to mention the used sources. All methods used in "MethodsFromArticle.ipynb" are taken from the article called "Projection of Supply and Use tables: methods and their empirical assessment"  
Working Paper Number: 2  
Authors: Umed Temurshoev, Norihiko Yamano and Colin Webb.

Also we emplement standart proximal gradient method (GradProjection) which is described in many sources (in particular we refer to russian book "МЕТОДЫ ОПТИМИЗАЦИИ И ИССЛЕДОВАНИЕ ОПЕРАЦИЙ ДЛЯ БАКАЛАВРОВ ИНФОРМАТИКИ" by Б.А.Гадких part 2.)

The describtion of studied problem is represented in aforementioned article and also in the "TaskDescription.pdf" but in russian.
